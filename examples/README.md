# Reprojection example
This example shows how to use the data loader, reprojection warp function with occlusion and reflectance masking and the analysis tools.
```
./reprojection_example

# Reprojection analysis
This example will go through the whole data set and reproject every frames' pixel into the own camera frame.
This will generate the analysis results shown in [results](https://github.com/rikba/hypersim_multiview/tree/2f239c22194c3472e06d9c8742c14bfab03dd28c/results).
```
./reprojection_analysis
```
